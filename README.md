# Farnborough

## Where we are now 

### Version 0.1 towards v1.0!

The main features of the site will be

* Home
* Walks
* Photos
* Events
* Contacts - Businesses, Organisations, Places and Amenities finder

These are what we have kicked off with and there are a few gaps to fill before this begins to feel like a well-designed app. 

This project is going to be built using the Agile approach.

## Roadmap

### Something to talk about at the North Camp Matters event

__13/02/2017__

Talk about the current website and that we are now developing a new project which is way more advanced! We are looking to garner interest in FG with the people of North Camp
and Farnborough as a whole. We will be taking people on as early as possible, with a choice of different member packs, that will creep up in price with the possibility later of 
upgrade. This is purely because we are constantly improving the service and that we won't charge full whack to the first members but will offer them new features later for a higher premium. 
This strategy means we can take on customers today rather than at the "end" of the projects development timeline.

### How we can leverage the BNI

I am going to visit as a visitor once more and shall deliver an update on FG together with a flyer this time including screenshots of the site. 
We shall become a member (HeadForCode/FarnboroughGuide) and each week we shall aim to announce a new feature and new member services, to encourage new members to join at the highest level possible and existing members to upgrade to cool new features.
We need to cause a bit of a stir :-)
