# Teaching notes

All projects we work on like this one will come with a teaching-notes file that I will use to add resources, important steps and so on that you can refer to directly in VSC or any editor that you use.

## Created branch "categorypage"

I created a new branch called "categorypage" that has added some new code to the project mainly to enable us to list our categories as we created them on Graph.Cool recently. We can now add new ones and delete old ones. So complete functionality to manage the categories.

Things to think about:

* If this was online, anybody would be able to update our data
* We would need to prevent that by adding a login screen at some point
* Not urgent as we are currently only running this from our laptops

### So what has the "categorypage" branch introduced?

We created the following new files:

* Category.js
* CreateCategory.js
* ListCategory.js
* teaching-notes.md (this file!!)

We changed the following:

* index.js
* package.json

You can jump into each of the above files and will find some comments scattered throughout the code, where I have added new bits.

You can go through them in order of above but it may be worth looking at index.js first, because this is the actual starting point for the app. 

Last of all please ask questions and I can explain in more depth, point you in the direction of other resources or book in time to walk through things in more depth when I am at the office.
