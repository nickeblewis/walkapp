We want to change the layout of the introduction text that appears 
on the homepage. I shall explain how we want it to be restructured.

First of all though...

Grab all of the latest changes and create a new branch to work from:

* git pull for the latest changes made by myself
* git checkout -b "introblockchanges"

We shall be working with just one file for this piece of work and 
that is IntroBlock.js, you can get to it quickly in VSC by pressing 
CTRL+P which reveals the search drop-down. Type in "IntroBlock.js" and select
it to open the file in VSC.

I have added some comments to the above file, so go over there to 
learn more about what needs doing :-)
